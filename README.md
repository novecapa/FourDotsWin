# FourDotsWin - SwiftUI Project

This project is an example implementation of a game similar to Connect 4 using SwiftUI.
The main goal is to provide an interactive game between a human player and the machine, along with the ability to store and display results of previous games.

## Features

- **Connect 4 Game:** The application features a classic Connect 4 game where a human player competes against the machine on an interactive game board.
- **Two TabBars:** The application utilizes two tabs for better organization and user experience. One tab focuses on a gameplay, while the other displays a history of results.
- **Results History:** In the results tab, a list of previous games is shown, including information such as the winner, date and time of the game, as well as its duration.
- **Clean Architecture:** The project follows the principles of Clean Architecture to ensure clear separation of concerns and easy scalability and maintenance of the codebase.
- **SOLID Principles:** SOLID principles are applied to promote clean, flexible, and extensible code design.
- **Data Persistence with SwiftData:** For storing game results, SwiftData, a Swift data persistence library providing a simple and efficient solution, has been integrated.
